## Weekly merging into master :
 
Weekly, the last properly working version of dev is going to be merged into master and will be given the tag WEEKx with x the number of the week of the merge.
 
## branch master :
 
This branch is always functioning and ready to be delivered at any time. It’s updated weekly by the last functioning commit of dev. It is considered the final product.
 
 
## branch dev :
 
This branch is supposed to be always functioning and bug free. In case, a contribution doesn’t match with the dev branch and causes problems, please try to alert everyone and also focus on getting dev to work as soon as possible.
 
 
## branches for issues :
 
Everytime a contributor creates an issue and works on it until done, he keeps committing into a branch created for that issue. When the issue is done, he merges his work into dev and checks if there is an eventual problem caused by incompatibility of those two branches.
